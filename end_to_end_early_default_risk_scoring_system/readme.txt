Early Default Scorecard: Interpretable Modeling and Monitoring Framework

Overview
This project is an end-to-end build of a production-grade Early Default Scorecard. It focuses on identifying early signs of loan default using interpretable techniques aligned with credit risk governance and modeling best practices.

The goal is to replicate the real-world workflow of a credit risk data scientist: from variable selection through logistic regression, WOE/IV transformation, tree-based modeling, and finally, scorecard stability monitoring (PSI/CSI).

Business Objective
To develop a scorecard that accurately detects borrowers likely to default early in their loan lifecycle, enabling proactive credit policy decisions, tighter underwriting, or earlier interventions.
