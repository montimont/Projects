# Projects

Welcome to my personal project hub which serves as a curated collection of real-world data science, machine learning, and risk modeling work. These projects demonstrate my ability to solve complex problems across domains including credit risk, automation, time series forecasting, and natural language processing.

Each project is self-contained and includes a blog-style walkthrough or notebook that explains the technical and business logic behind the solution.

# About Me

I'm a financial technologist and risk modeler with 7+ years of experience building data-driven systems across lending, healthcare, and education. My work bridges the gap between technical modeling and executive strategy. This repo is a living showcase of that.
